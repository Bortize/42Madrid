# Netwhat-calculator

## Getting Started

### Installing

git clone https://github.com/lcols19/Netwhat-calculator.git


### Running the tests

Four scripts are available to help : nbr_adr, tobinary, ntw_adr and host_range.
<br>

nbr_adr : gives the number of host addresses available on a network attached to a given IP address.<br>
The argument is the CIDR number of this IP address.

tobinary : takes a decimal number, turns it into a binary.<br>
The argument is the decimal writing of the octet.

ntw_adr : gives network and broadcast addresses.<br>
The argument is the IP address with the CIDR.

host_range : gives the host range.<br>
The first argument is the last octet, the second the CIDR.
<br>

To run any script, type "sh [name-of-the-script].sh [argument]"
